This was an assignment in which we had to create a web application of our own choosing.
Even though the creation of a weather web application is not anything original or a service that the current market is missing,
I decided that it was a good enough place to start.

One of the challenges of this particular assignment was the implementation of a log-in system, since we hadn't done anything similar
at this point in our bachelor's. Although, with a bit of research, it appeared to be a more than possible implementation to apply to this
assignment. Furthermore, another challenge would be acquiring the data for the weather based on the user's requested country. In order to 
acquire such data, an API (Application Program Interface has to be used, which allows a developer to access a database of information and
present it on their project/program/website. In this particular case, the openweathermap API was used, since it didn't have a big limit on the requests
that could be made in a day and it was free, which made it more convenient.

The website used to be hosted on a service called, infinityfree, but due to the service being free, it meant that the site could be hosted there for a 
limited amount of time. So the only way as of now to use the site to manually host it, which is not convinient, but it is possible that I will soon host the
service in my personal home server.

The use of the service was simple, the user only had to type the city they were interested in seeing the weather forecast, and they would be presented with 
information up to a couple hours and a few days as well.
